# MultiURLs

This is a PHP project I created to practice my programming skills. It is a bookmark saving site that allows you to view all your chosen web pages on one page.

## Getting Started

This project runs on a LAMP stack. The folder named 'config' goes outside the root directory as it contains the MySQL database login details. The file named dbinstallSQL.txt contains the SQL to recreate the database locally.

### Prerequisites

Javascript, PHP, MySQL
