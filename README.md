# MultiURLs

This is a PHP project I created to practice my programming skills. It is a bookmark saving site that allows you to view all your chosen web pages on one page.

## Getting Started

1. This project runs on a LAMP stack.
2. The file named dbinstallSQL.txt contains the SQL to recreate the MySQL database for this project.
3. The folder named 'exampleconfig' goes outside the root directory, or in a password protected directory, as it contains the MySQL database login details in plain text - when you move it make sure you change the include reference in index.php.


### Prerequisites

Javascript, PHP, MySQL
